# Contributing

We love and welcome contributions to this list! To add a new link to this list, add the link to `data.json` and run `npm start`. This will generate the README.md properly based on data from your github repo - including grabbing the description from the repo.

Please be sure to use a `category` that's properly cased for the heading itself, as we use those headers directly. If you're unsure what to put, simply make a PR and we'll discuss more in the review process!
